# Covid-19-squence-analysis
Used nucleotide sequences for COVID-19 with release date up to Feb.26 2020 from NCBI. 

Computed distance matrix by pairwise alignment of 42 genomic sequences (length 30000) using dynamic programming combined with divide&amp;conquer method. 

Resulted in a neighbour joining tree showing the relations between covid-19 virus found in different locations using Trex.
